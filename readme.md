#One Rep Max Calculator

##A super simple application for calculating 1rm's for lifters. 

Created as an exercise in design.

If you're looking for examples of code you came to the wrong place because this entire application is under 300LOC :P

The coefficients for calculation are from exrx.net.

You can do whatever you want with it :)

Have fun!
